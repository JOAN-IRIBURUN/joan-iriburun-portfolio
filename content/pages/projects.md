        text: >
          This dashboard provides an intuitive overview of sales performance
          across multiple distributors, regions, and product categories. It
          consolidates key metrics such as total sales, growth trends,
          distributor performance, and product sales to help businesses track
          progress, identify top performers, and optimize strategies for growth.
          The dashboard includes visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and
          maps to make data analysis accessible and actionable for
          decision-makers.

          For this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to
          analyze over 1.76 million 911 calls for the Austin Police Department.
          By focusing on key metrics like response times, mental health-related
          incidents, and resource allocation, the dashboard provides actionable
          insights to help improve police operations and public safety. Using
          SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard
          supports data-driven decision-making and enhances the department's
          ability to optimize resources and respond effectively to incidents.
