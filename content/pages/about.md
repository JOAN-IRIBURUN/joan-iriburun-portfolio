      I’m Joan, a Data Analyst specializing in transforming data into clear,
      actionable insights using Excel, Power BI, and Microsoft Word. I am
      passionate about helping businesses unlock the full potential of their
      data to make informed, data-driven decisions.


      Through my work, I create interactive dashboards, in-depth reports, and
      data visualizations that drive business performance and provide clarity on
      complex data. Whether it's optimizing sales strategies, improving
      operational efficiency, or understanding customer behavior, I use data to
      tell the story that drives business growth.
