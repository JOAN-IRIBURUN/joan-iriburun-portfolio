      Hi, I’m Joan, a Data Analyst with a passion for turning complex data into
      clear, actionable insights. I specialize in using Excel, Power BI, and
      Microsoft Word to analyze, visualize, and communicate data effectively. My
      goal is to help organizations make data-driven decisions that optimize
      performance and drive growth.


      With a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization, I create
      intuitive dashboards, detailed reports, and compelling visualizations that
      tell the story behind the numbers. I’m eager to continue building my
      skills and contribute to projects that use data to solve real-world
      business challenges.
